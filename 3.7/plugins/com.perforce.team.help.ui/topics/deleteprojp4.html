<h1>Deleting a Project from the Depot</h1>
<p>By default, when you delete a project, its files are marked for delete in Perforce 
  and deleted when you submit the changelist that contains them. If you disable 
  the <B>Enable support for Workbench edit, 
delete, rename and refactoring operations </B>preference, 
  you must manually open the files for delete if you intend to remove them from 
  the depot</p>
<p>To delete files that are under Perforce control, you open the files for delete, 
  then submit the changelist in which they are open. Perforce adds a file revision 
  marked &quot;deleted&quot; to the depot (but retains all previous revisions), 
  and deletes the files from your workspace. Note that deleting the files from 
  the depot does not remove them from WebSphere Studio Application Developer. If 
  you are getting rid of the project completely, delete it from the Perforce depot 
  first, then from WebSphere Studio Application Developer.</p>
<p>To delete a project from the depot:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Package Explorer view, right-click the project and choose <b>Team&gt;Mark for Delete...</b> Project files are removed from the list.</li> 
  <li>In the P4 Pending Changelist view, right-click the changelist that contains the files to be deleted and choose <b>Submit...</b> The Perforce Change Specification is displayed.
  <li>Enter a description and click <B>Submit</B>.
  </ol>
