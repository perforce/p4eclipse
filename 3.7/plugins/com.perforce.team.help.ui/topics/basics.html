<h1>Introduction to Perforce</h1>
<h2>Basic Terminology </h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Depot</b>: the central repository where file revisions are stored and 
    managed by the Perforce Server.</li>
  <li> <b>Workspace</b>: the area on your computer where you work with your copies 
    of files that are under Perforce control.</li>
  <li><b>Perforce Server</b>: the program that manages file revisions.</li>
  <li><b>Changelist</b>: A group of files, with a description explaining how you&#146;ve 
    changed them (for example, &#147;Fix bug #123&#148;). Changelists are assigned 
    numbers by the Perforce Server so you can track them. Changelists enable you to group related files and submit them together.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagram shows the relationship between workspace and depot.

<h2>Basic Tasks</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Retrieve</b> a file: Retrieve a copy of a file version from the depot. <b>Note:</b> Perforce also uses the term "sync" to mean "retrieve a file." This usage is different from the Eclipse term "synchronize."</li>
   <li> <b>Check out</b>: enables you to change the file.  
  <li> <b>Mark</b> for add or delete: indicates that the file is added to or deleted from the depot when the changelist is submitted .</li>
  <li> <b>Revert</b> a file: Discard any changes you have made to an open file. 
    If you open a file for edit and make changes, then change your mind and revert 
    the file, Perforce reloads the last version you got from the depot and discards 
    your changes.</li>
  <li> <b>Submit</b> a changelist: Update the depot to reflect any changes you&#146;ve 
    made to files in the changelist. Submitting is an all-or-nothing operation: if there&#146;s 
    a problem submitting one file in a changelist, none of the other files in 
    the changelist are updated.</li>
</ul>
    <h2>Perforce File Decorations</h2>
    <p>File decorations indicate status as follows.</p>
