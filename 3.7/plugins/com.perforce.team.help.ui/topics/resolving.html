<h1>Team Development and Resolving Conflicting Changes</h1>	


File conflicts can occur when you submit a changelist containing a file that another 
user has edited and checked in. When conflicts occur, Perforce schedules the 
conflict files for resolve. Conflicts must be resolved before the changelist that contains 
the conflicting files can be successfully submitted. 
<p><B>To resolve a file</B>: right-click the file in the Pending Changelist pane and choose <strong>Resolve...</strong> There are two methods to resolve file conflicts:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Automatic Resolve</b>: to resolve without launching the merge utility, specify how you want to resolve the conflicting files.</p>
  <p>The options available when auto-resolving are as follows: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Accept source</b>: accept the latest version of the file 
     in the depot, containing changes made by other users</li>
    <li><b>Accept target</b>: accept the version of the file you 
     checked out and changed in your workspace </li>
    <li><b>Safe automatic resolve</b>: accept only when source or 
     target differs from base</li>
    <li><b>Allow merging with no conflicts</b>: Resolve by merging, 
     skipping files with conflicts</li>
    <li><b>Allow merging with conflict markers</b>: Resolve by merging,
     replacing your workspace's file with the merged result, including
     any conflict markers</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Interactive Resolve</b>: to run the merge utility so you can 
    compare the conflicting files and choose individual chunks, or 
    edit the file contents, choose Manual Resolve.</p></blockquote>
<p>By default, you are prompted to choose the resolve method. To avoid
having to do this every time, you can select and set a default resolve 
method, and the Resolve wizard will use the UI that corresponds to your
selected default resolve method.</p>
<p>You can change the default resolve method in the preference page
under <b>Team &gt; Perforce &gt; Resolve</b>. You can also customize
the resolve options in the resolve preference page.</p>
