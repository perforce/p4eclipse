<h1>Removing a Project from Perforce Control</h1>


<p>To remove a project from Perforce control, right-click the project and choose 
  <b>Team&gt;Unmanage</b>. To verify that the project is no longer under Perforce 
  control, right-click the project and choose <b>Team</b>. The only option displayed 
  for an unmanaged project is <b>Share Project...</b></p>
<p>Note that, although Perforce is no longer configured as the SCM provider for 
  the project, its files remain in the depot and in your workspace. If you have 
  any project files open in changelists, they remain open in the changelist (and 
  can be submitted). To put the project under Perforce control again, proceed 
  as described in <a href="adding.html">Putting a Project under Perforce Control</a>. 
  Be advised that, if you have made changes to the project after removing it from Perforce 
  control, your changes will be overwritten if you sync (retrieve) the project files using a different Perforce client application (for example, P4V). </p>
