<h1> Checking in Changes (Working with Changelists)</h1>
<p>To check in changes you have made to the files in a project, you <i>submit</i> 
  the changelist containing the files. Use changelists to structure your changes. 
  For example, use a changelist to group the changes required to fix a bug or 
  add a feature. This approach enables you to keep the revision history of your project files coherent.</p>
<p>To check in changes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the P4 Pending Changelists view, right-click the changelist that 
    contains the files you want to check in and choose <b>Submit...</b> The Perforce 
    Change Specification dialog is displayed.</li><p>
  <li>Enter a description of your changes. If there are files you do not want 
    to submit, un-check them. Any files that you do not submit remain checked out.</li><p>
  <li>Click <b>Submit</b>. Your changes are submitted. To verify, check the Perforce 
    Log Console view for messages like those in the following figure (note the <tt>p4 submit </tt>command and the absence of error messages).</li>
  <p>
</ol>

<p>To create a changelist, click <img src="../images/newchange.png" alt="new changelist" width="14" height="13">in the P4 Pending Changelists view.<b></b></p>
<p>To move files among changelists, select the files in the P4 Pending Changelist 
  view and drag them to the target changelist.</p>
<p>To compare the state of the project in your workspace with the version in the 
  depot, right-click the project in the navigator and choose <b>Team&gt;Check 
  Consistency...</b> P4 for Eclipse displays files you have added to or deleted from the
  project, enabling you to make sure that you check in the correct project files, 
  as shown in the following figure. Click OK to mark files for add or delete as 
  required, or click Cancel to dismiss the dialog without opening any files.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you submit a changelist, you might encounter file conflicts that require 
  resolution. Conflicts can occur, for example, if another user checks in changes 
  after you check a file out. Perforce requires you to decide how the two differing 
  versions of the file are resolved. For more details, see <a href="resolving.html">Team 
  Development and Resolving Conflicting Changes.</a></p>
<p>Changelists submitted by you and other users are listed in the P4 Submitted 
  Changelists view. You can filter this view to display only the changelists pertaining to a specified user, path, and workspace. 
  To clear the filter, click <img src="../images/eraser.png" width="24" height="22"></p>
