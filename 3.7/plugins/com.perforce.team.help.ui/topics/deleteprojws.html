<h1>Deleting a Project from Your Workspace</h1>


<p>You can delete project files from your client workspace without deleting the project 
  from the depot. Local files are removed but the project remains under Perforce control. 
<p>To delete files from your workspace, right-click the project and choose <b>Team&gt;Remove 
  from Workspace</b>. To restore the files, right-click the project and choose <b>Team&gt;Get Latest Revision.</b></p>
