<h1>Defect Tracking (Perforce Jobs)</h1>

<p>Perforce jobs enable you to track the status of work such as bug reports and 
  feature requests. You can attach jobs to changelists, to associate it with the 
  file changes that implement the job. When you check in the changelist, the job status is updated. Jobs are listed in the Perforce perspective's P4 Jobs view.</p>
<p><strong>To create a new job</strong>, click <img src="../images/newconnection.png" alt="Plus sign" width="12" height="12">. </p>
<p><strong>To edit a job</strong>, double-click it.</p>
<p><b>To change the job fields</b> that are displayed in the jobs pane, click 
  <img src="../images/jobcolumns.png" width="24" height="23">.</p>
<p><b>To add a job to a changelist</b>: right-click the changelist, choose <b>Add 
  Jobs...</b> and select the job that you want to add to the changelist.</p>
<p><b>To filter the job list</b>: enter the filter criteria in the Keyword and Folder/file fields
  at the top of the jobs pane. You can filter based on the contents of a field 
  (for example, ReportedDate&gt;2003/01/01) or search for words in the description 
  (for example, &quot;assigned&quot;). For details about searching jobs, refer 
  to Perforce user documentation.</p>
<p><strong>To change data in one or more fields in <em>all</em> the jobs in a server</strong>, right-click a job in the Jobs view and choose <strong>Bulk Edit Jobs...</strong></p>
<h2>Managing Jobs with Mylyn</h2>
<p>Be sure to enable <strong>Preferences&gt;Team&gt;Perforce&gt;Mylyn&gt;Use Mylyn Task editor by default when editing jobs</strong>. Define a task repository for the server that contains the required Perforce jobs.</p>
<p>You can <strong>configure how job fields are displayed</strong>: display <strong>Preferences</strong>, choose <strong>Team &gt; Perforce &gt; Mylyn &gt; Job Layout</strong>, and arrange the fields by dragging and dropping them into the desired arrangement.</p>
<p>You can also view the changes that have been made to a Perforce job. To do so, your Perforce installation must have a <em>spec depot</em> configured. (For details about spec depots, consult your Perforce administrator or the <em><a href="http://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.current/manuals/p4sag/index.html">Perforce System Administrator's Guide</a></em>.) <strong>To display the changes using Time-lapse View</strong>, click <img src="../images/history.png" alt="history icon" width="18" height="16">. <strong>To list the changes</strong> that have been made to the job, click <img src="../images/historylist.png" alt="History list" width="13" height="18">. <strong>To diff two revisions of a job</strong>, drag one to the other.</p>
