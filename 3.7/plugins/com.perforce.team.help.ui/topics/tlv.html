<h1>Time-lapse View: Interactive Annotation Tool</h1>
<p>Time-lapse View displays an interactive graphical representation of a file's 
  history, showing when lines were added, changed, and deleted, who made the changes, 
  and when the changes were made. Time-lapse View enables you to browse forward 
  and back through changes dynamically,  to locate changes of interest.</p>
<p>To display Time-lapse View, right-click the file of interest and choose <strong>Team&gt;Time-lapse View</strong>. To move through revisions, use the slider.  Time-lapse View is syntax-sensitive (C/C++, Java, and Ruby), enabling you to navigate file content using an outline view. To hide information that is not of interest, for example, to display only the changes to a single method, fold information using the +/- expander buttons.</p>
<p>To control the display, use the following settings and features, which are displayed in the toolbar.</p>
