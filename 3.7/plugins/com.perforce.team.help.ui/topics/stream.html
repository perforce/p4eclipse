<h1>Work with Streams</h1>

<p>Streams provide an alternate approach to maintaining codelines.
<p>Starting with release <strong>2012.1</strong>, P4 for Eclipse
provides the following support for streams:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating a Stream Spec</li>
  <li>Populating a Stream</li>
  <li>Viewing Stream Hierarchy</li>
  <li>Creating a Stream Client</li>
  <li>Copying and Merging Changes between Streams</li>
</ul>

<p>If your organization uses streams, you will see streams depots in the
<strong>P4 Connections</strong> view. Streams depots are marked with the <img
src="../images/stream_depot_icon.png" alt="Stream Depot" width="" height="">
icon. A hierarchical view of the streams and their relationships to each other
is displayed in the <b>P4 Streams</b> view, along with each stream's name,
root, parent, owner, type, and description. If P4V (the Perforce Visual Client
executable) is available, you can also obtain the P4V Streams Graph by clicking
the <strong>Streams Graph</strong> icon <img src="../images/stream_graph.png"
alt="Streams graph icon"/> in the <strong>P4 Streams</strong> view. </p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p></p>

<h2>Create a Stream Spec</h2>

<p>From the <strong>P4 Streams</strong> view (or the 
<strong>Create New Stream from...</strong> context
menu item), click the <strong>Create a New Stream</strong>
button <img src="../images/addbranch.png"/>.  The <strong>New
Stream</strong> wizard will pop up.  To create a new Stream spec,
follow the wizard's prompts and click <strong>Finish</strong>.
Click <strong>Refresh</strong> button<img src="../images/refresh.png"/> on
the view toolbar to refresh the view and display the new stream.</p>

<h2>Populate a Stream</h2>

<p>A stream spec defines a path in the stream depot. If the path does not
exist, you need to populate the stream with content.</p>
<p>To populate a stream:</p>
<p>You can check the <strong>Branch files from parent on stream creation</strong> button in the <strong>New Stream</strong> wizard.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a new connection in the <strong>P4 Connections</strong>
    view and set your Perforce workspace's <strong>Stream</strong>  
    value to the stream you want to populate.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>P4 Stream</strong> view, select the stream and 
    choose <strong>Merge to Stream</strong>.</li>
  <li>Select the parent stream as the source, select <strong>Merge</strong>, 
    Resolve any files (accepting the source), and then submit the 
    changelist.</li> 
</ul>
<p>If you are familiar with P4V, you can also:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Invoke the P4V graph view 
   <img src="../images/stream_graph.png" alt="Streams graph icon"/> 
   to populate the stream from the <strong>P4 Streams</strong> view. </li>
  <li><strong>Note:</strong> in order to enable context menu functionality in 
    the stream graph, you will need to select the P4V Preference named
    <strong>Use the same workspace, and switch it between streams.</strong>
    (You can set this preference in the Streams page of P4V Preferences.)</li>
  <li>Use the context menu in the P4V Graph View as you would otherwise
    use it from within P4V.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Delete a Stream</h2>

<p>You can delete a stream if it has not children. To delete: select a 
stream from <strong>P4 Streams</strong> view and choose <strong>Delete 
Stream</strong> from context menu.</p>

<h2>View Stream hierarchy</h2>
The <strong>P4 Streams</strong> view can show streams either as a tree 
<img src="../images/tree_layout.png"/>
or list <img src="../images/flat_layout.png"/>.  If you have P4V 
configured in the preferences page, the P4V Stream Graph view can 
also be invoked from the <strong>P4 Streams</strong> 
view toolbar <img src="../images/stream_graph.png" alt="Streams graph view">.

<h2>Create a Stream Client</h2>
<p>To work with a stream depot, a stream client is needed. To create a stream
client, select a connection from the <strong>P4 Connections</strong> view, 
select <strong>Edit Perforce Workspace...</strong> from the context 
menu, set the <strong>Stream</strong> field (and optionally, specify the 
<strong>AtChange</strong> field), and save the spec.</p>

<p><img src="../images/stream_client.png" alt="Streams client dialog"></p>

<h3>Work in a Stream</h3>
<p>Alternatively, you can select the context menu <strong>Work in this Stream...</strong> 
of the <strong>P4 Streams</strong> View, P4 for Eclipse will prompt you to either
update the current Perforce client to associate with selected stream, or create
a new client to associate with the selected stream, based on the preference. 
The default behavior is to update the current client to associate with the 
selected stream.</p>
<p>Once you select the stream client, P4 for Eclipse will automatically switch the
Perforce workspace and synchronize the existing projects to the latest revision.</p>

<h2>Copy and Merge Changes between Streams</h2>
<hr>

<p>Consider the following set of streams:</p>

<p><img src="../images/stream_graph.jpg" alt="Streams graph view"></p>

<p>After fixing a bug or implementing a new feature in a 
development stream, you may want to copy up your changes 
to the main stream. Or you may want to merge down the 
changes from the main stream to the development stream.</p>
<p>Prior to the 2012.3 release, you needed to manually switch to target streams.
Since the 2012.3 release, the support for automatically
switching between streams was added and working with multiple streams is much easier.
</p>

<h3>Auto-switch streams</h3>
<p>When you invoke the <b>Copy to Stream...</b> and <b>Merge to Stream...</b> actions,
    P4 for Eclipse will automatically switch to the target stream if necessary.</p>

<h4>To copy changes from the development stream to the main stream:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Open P4 Streams view, and select the main stream, context-click
  <b>Copy to Stream...</b>, if you are currently in dev stream, P4Eclipse
  will automatically switch to the main stream, and synchronize the resources.</li>
  <li>You can then follow the prompts from the <strong>Copy to Stream</strong> wizard, 
    and click <strong>Copy</strong> to finish. </li>
  <li>Resolve the pending changelist and submit the change.</li>
</ul>

<h4>To merge changes from the main stream to the development stream:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Open P4 Streams view, and select the dev stream, context-click
  <b>Merge to Stream...</b>, if you are currently in main stream, P4Eclipse
  will automatically switch to the dev stream, and synchronize the resources.</li>
  <li>You can then follow the prompts from the <strong>Merge to Stream</strong> wizard, 
    and click <strong>Merge</strong> to finish. </li>
  <li>Resolve the pending changelist and submit the change.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Work with Task Stream</h2>
<p>Task stream provide a light way to branch streams. Usually you work with task stream for
a minor bug fix or a small feature development.</p>

<p>P4 Eclipse provide following support for task stream, and most of them are available from the <strong>P4 Streams</strong> view:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Create a task stream</li>
	<li>Populate a task stream
		<ul>
			<li>From parent stream</li>
			<li>From a depot</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Work in a task stream</li>
	<li>Delete a task stream</li>
	<li>Unload/reload a task stream</li>
	<li>Re-parent a task stream</li>
</ul>

<h3>Task Stream Workflow</h3>
<p>The following workflow is suggested but not required:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Create a task stream relate to a task (feature or bug)</li>
	<li>Checkout files in task stream</li>
	<li>Modify the files in the task stream</li>
	<li>Submit files to task stream</li>
	<li>Copy changes up to parent</li>
	<li>Unload or delete task stream</li>
</ul>
