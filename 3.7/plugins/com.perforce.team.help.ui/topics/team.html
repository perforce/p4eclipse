<h1>Team Programming with Perforce</h1>
<p>When multiple Eclipse users are modifying the same files, keep the following recommended practices in mind: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Use development branches to isolate and stabilize work.</li>
  <li>Keep your development branches up to date by merging down changes made to the parent.</li>
  <li>Before integrating work from a development branch to its parent, make sure the branch is stable and that you have merged down all changes made to the parent.</li>
  <li>Use the Eclipse Synchronize view to track changes that need to be synced to the local workspace. </li>
</ul>
