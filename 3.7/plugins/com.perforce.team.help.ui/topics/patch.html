<h1>Patching Projects</h1>
<p>To share work without checking in changes, you can create <em>patches</em>, which are files that encode the changes made to a selected set of files. The resulting patch file can be <em>applied</em> by other users who want to see and try your changes. (The Perforce <a href="shelving.html">shelving</a> feature is another way to share work without checking it in.)</p>
<p><strong>To create a patch file from a project that you have edited:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Context-click the desired project or resource and choose <strong>Team&gt;Create Patch</strong>.The Create Patch wizard is launched.</li>
  <li>Specify the location where the patch is to be saved (clipboard, file system or Eclipse workspace).</li>
  <li>Adjust the precise content and format of the patch as desired.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Finish</strong>. </li>
</ol>
<p>You can send the resulting file to other developers who are working on the project, and they can apply the patch file to view and test your changes.</p>
<p><strong>To apply a patch:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Context-click the project and choose <strong>Team&gt;Apply Patch</strong>.</li>
  <li>Browse to the patch file and apply it.</li>
</ol>
