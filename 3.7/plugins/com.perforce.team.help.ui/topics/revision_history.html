<h1>Displaying File Status and History</h1>
<p>You can display the following types of information about files:
<ul>
  <li><b>File status</b>: the current state of the file as managed by Perforce, 
    indicated by label decorations</li>
  <li><b>File properties</b>: location, number of revisions, and so on. Displayed 
    on the Perforce Properties dialog.</li>
  <li><b>Revision history</b>: the changes that have been checked into the depot, 
    including a description of the change, date, user, and so on.</li>
  <li><b>Submitted changelists</b>: previously-submitted changelists, including 
    a list of files submitted.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also <a href="#search">search</a> the contents of files under Perforce control using a grep-style search.
<h2>File Status</H2>
<p>To view the status of open files, examine the file icons in the P4 Pending 
  Changelist view. The <i>label decorations</i> displayed on the icons indicate 
  the status of the file. For example, the following figure shows files open for 
  delete (red x), edit (red check mark), and add (red +).</p>

<h2>File Properties</H2>
<p>To display file properties:
<ol>
  <li>Right-click the file in the Navigator view and choose <b>Properties</b>.</li>
  <li>Click <b>Perforce</b>. File properties are displayed as shown in the following 
    figure. </li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the <i>head</i> revision is the revision most recently checked in, 
  and the <i>have</i> revision is the one last synced to your workspace.
<h2>Revision History</H2>
<p>To display the revision history of a file, right-click the file and choose 
<b>Revision History.</b></p>
<p>The  History view lists the following details about the revisions 
  of a file that have been submitted to the Perforce depot: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Revision</b>: the revision number of the file. Every time you (successfully) 
    submit the file, its revision number is incremented.</li>
  <p> 
  <li><b>Changelist</b>: the changelist number associated with the file revision 
    when it was submitted to the depot. This number is assigned by Perforce, and 
    is used to group related files when submitting them. For example, if you change 
    several files in the process of fixing a bug or adding a feature, the changelist 
    number identifies the point at which the change was submitted. You can use 
    the changelist number to sync the files to your workspace as a group. </li>
  <p> 
  <li><b>Date</b>: the date the changelist was submitted.</li>
  <p> 
  <li><b>User</b>: the Perforce user name of the user who submitted the changelist</li>
  <p> 
  <li><b>Action</b>: the action perforce on the file, for example, add, edit, 
    or delete.</li>
  <p> 
  <li><b>Description</b>: details about the changelist, entered by the user who 
    submitted the changelist.</li>
  <p> 
</p></ul>
<p>To compare two revisions to see what changes have been made, select the desired 
  revisions, then right-click and choose <b>Diff Two Revisions</b>. The <b>Diff 
  Two Revisions</b> dialog is displayed, highlighting the differences between 
  the files, as shown in the following figure.

<p>To search the contents of files in a Perforce depot:
<ol>
  <li>Click the toolbar Search button. The Search dialog is displayed.</li>
  <li>Click the P4 Grep tab. </li>
  <li>Specify the text you are seeking, the files to be searched, and any search options. </li>
